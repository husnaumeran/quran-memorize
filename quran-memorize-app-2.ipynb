    "\n",
    "App appears as icon on home screen and opens fullscreen like a native app.\n",
    "- Consider Google AdSense or direct Islamic business sponsorships\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Monetization (when user base grows)\n",
    "- Sponsorships from Islamic businesses/organizations\n",

    "Great question! There are several approaches for earning revenue without disrupting the user experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Subtle Ad Placements**\n",
    "- Footer ads (below the main content, only visible when scrolling down)\n",
    "- Ads only on non-core pages (like settings or about page)\n",
    "- Interstitial ads between sessions (not during memorization)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Donation-Based (you already have this!)**\n",
    "- Your \"Buy Me a Coffee\" link is a good start\n",
    "- Could add occasional gentle reminders after completing a session\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Sponsorships**\n",
    "- Reach out to Islamic businesses, bookstores, or halal brands\n",
    "- A small \"Sponsored by...\" banner is often well-received by users\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Freemium Model**\n",
    "- Keep basic features free\n",
    "- Offer premium features (offline audio, custom playlists, progress tracking) for a small fee\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Affiliate Links**\n",
    "- Link to Quran-related products (physical Qurans, courses, apps)\n",
    "- Earn commission on purchases\n",
    "\n",
    "For a Quran memorization app, I'd lean toward **donations + sponsorships** since many users appreciate ad-free religious apps, and Islamic businesses are often happy to support beneficial projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which approach interests you most?"

    "\n",
    "For **sponsorships**, here's the basic idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify potential sponsors** — Islamic bookstores, halal food brands, Muslim-owned businesses, Islamic education platforms, or even local mosques with online programs\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reach out** — Send a simple email/message explaining your app, your audience, and offering ad space in exchange for a monthly fee or one-time payment\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What to offer them** — A small banner or \"Sponsored by [Company]\" text with their logo and link\n",
    "\n",
    "**To get started:**\n",
    "- How many users/visits does your app get (roughly)? This helps when approaching sponsors.\n",
    "- Do you have any Islamic businesses or organizations in mind that might be interested?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a sense of potential sponsors, I can help you draft an outreach message if you'd like!"
